# hamFoam
Heat and Moisture transport solver for building physics. OpenFOAM based.

Initial testing has been done. Works. Finer details about material properties etc. will be adjusted. Once the adjustements have been done, a comparison to COMSOL will be added.

Measurement data by Tampere University, Building Physics team led by Juha Vinha. We have more data than is published here.
